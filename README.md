# brains
Kaggle competition on classifying harmful brain activity.

## Instructions
You first need to link your GitHub with your Kaggle account. You can do this in your Kaggle account settings.

To save a notebook from Kaggle to GitHub, on the Kaggle "File" menu, click "Link to GitHub". Then, when you save the notebook, it will ask you to find a repository. You should be able to get to "allispaul/brains" (though let me know if you have issues, since it's a private repo). You can then write a commit message and commit the notebook.

To load a notebook from GitHub into Kaggle, make a new notebook, go to "File -> Import Notebook", click on "GitHub", find the repository, and find the notebook.
